This property is called inertia. Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion. More massive objects have greater inertia, meaning they require more force to change their motion. Examples include a hockey puck sliding on ice continuing until friction stops it, or passengers lurching forward when a car suddenly brakes.",
