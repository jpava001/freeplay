Factories replaced small workshops, drawing millions of workers from rural areas into rapidly growing cities. This urbanization created overcrowded living conditions and public health challenges. Meanwhile, new machinery dramatically increased production capacity, making goods cheaper and more available but also replacing skilled artisans with factory workers who performed repetitive tasks for long hours.",

As bees collect nectar and pollen for food, pollen grains stick to their fuzzy bodies. When they visit other flowers, some of this pollen rubs off, pollinating the plants. Without bee pollination, many plants—including numerous food crops like apples, almonds, and blueberries—would fail to reproduce. Scientists estimate that bees are responsible for pollinating approximately one-third of the food crops humans consume.",

It begins with evaporation, where the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning it into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere.
